## Example

UIAlertController is nice and all, but it means having to write a few lines of code where before one call was often all you'd need. klAlert is a class with functions that let you create and handle the results of a modern alert in just one call:
```	
Alert().withButtons(title: "Confirm",
				msg: "Confirm an action.",
				cancel: "Cancel",
				buttons: ["OK"]) { (index) in
					guard result == 1 else { return }
					// Do the thing
				}
```
## Current Version: 1.0.8
A complete restructuring. 

## Installation
### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

1. Add the following to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```
use_frameworks! #if this isn't already in your podfile
pod "klAlert"
```
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Enjoy.

## Documentation
Until I have ample time, note that you can find at least simple examples of usage in the Demo app.
### Functions for the Class Alert
